        <p>Hello, stranger on the internet.</p>
<p>Currently, I work as a <strong>software security consultant</strong>, and my work
activities range between the <strong>penetration testing</strong> of <strong>web and mobile applications</strong>, <strong>secure code reviews</strong> and <strong>training activities</strong>.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe exactly what you will find in here. What I can
say is that in here I will share fragments of my life, such as
technical posts or more personal writings, which I think are worth
sharing. I do this as a way to explore ideas that interest me and also
with the intention of sharing something that can be useful for other
people as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm deeply interesting in our <strong>ability to learn</strong> and even more in
our <strong>ability to teach</strong>. A few years ago I decided that I would
master the <strong>art of teaching</strong>, and in order to improve my ability as
a teacher I started to create content online. First I did that in
italian, my mother tongue, with the project <strong>esadecimale</strong>, and
recently I've also started doing it in english with the project
<strong>hexdump</strong>. The subjects I teach are all related to <strong>Computer
Science</strong>, <strong>Programming</strong> and <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. Below you can find
my youtube channels where I regularly post new educational content:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqZe2cxQNCvgkQxUuqsIaig">Esadecimale (üáÆüáπ)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzPk3Dj63B6PIEifvVvDfBg">Hexdump (üåç)</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also deeply interested in other fields such as <strong>psychology</strong> and
<strong>philosophy</strong>. Having been through deep challenges in understanding
myself, other people, and the world in general while growing up, I
have developed a deep need for understanding.</p>
<center style="margin:20px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:30px;"><b> I strive to understand the world I was born into </b></center>
<p>I believe <strong>sharing knowledge is one of the most beautiful activity</strong>. The
beauty of learning is multifaceted: not only it improves your own
life, it can potentially improve also the lives of those around you.</p>
<center style="margin:20px; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:30px;"><b> A good life is about truth, and truth requires knowledge and wisdom </b></center>
<hr />
<p>I hope you find something useful and interesting in my work.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
